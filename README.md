# to_do_app_flask
A small and simple application created with Python/Flask.
It is a todo list with  some simple functions, they are:
1. Mark a task as a completed one 
2. Delete a task from the todo list
3. Add new task to the todo list
4. Delete all the task 
On the main page You can see all the tasks: completed and uncompleted
Templetes were created with the Bootstrap and I also used awesome-icons
